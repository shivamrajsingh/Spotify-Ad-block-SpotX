or

* Run The following command in PowerShell:
```ps1
[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12; iwr -useb 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amd64fox/SpotX/main/Install.ps1' | iex
```

<h1>Uninstall:</h1>

* Just run [Uninstall.bat](https://cutt.ly/dErpPEK)

or

* Reinstall Spotify ([Full uninstall](https://github.com/amd64fox/Uninstall-Spotify) recommended)



<h1>Possible problems:</h1>

 <details>
<summary><small>Outdated versions of PowerShell</small></summary><p>

If you are using Windows 7, there may be errors in the installation process due to an outdated version of NET Framework and PowerShell. 
   Do the following:
   * Upgrade to [NET Framework 4.8](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2088631)
   * Upgrade to [WMF 5.1](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=54616)
   * Reboot your PC

</details>

 <details>
<summary><small>After running Install.bat, the message "Curl command line utility not found" appeared</small></summary><p>

The curl command was not found in the system (in windows 10 and above it comes out of the box), you need to install it manually:
  *  Follow the [link](http://www.confusedbycode.com/curl/#downloads) and download the installation file, depending on the bitness of the OS.
  *  We start the installation process, at the end we must restart the PC.
  
</details>


<details>
<summary><small>How do I go back to the previous version of the client ?</small></summary><p>

  If you have problems with the patch after upgrading the client version, then use this [tool](https://github.com/amd64fox/Rollback-Spotify) to revert back to the working    version.

<h1>Additional Notes:</h1>

* The repository is based on <a href="https://github.com/mrpond/BlockTheSpot">BlockTheSpot</a>, and also some tricks were taken from <a href="https://github.com/khanhas/spicetify-cli">spicetify-cli</a>, many thanks to the contributors
* SpotX will only work correctly on the latest versions of Spotify, please make sure of this before asking a question.  
* The modifiable files are replaced by the Spotify installer every time it is updated, so you will need to apply the patch again when this happens.
* [SpotX will be installed even if you are using Spicetify](https://github.com/amd64fox/SpotX/discussions/28#discussioncomment-2389043), but you may need to run Install.bat again after running the `spicetify apply` or other commands.
